                  Rahn Consolidated normally collects personal information
                  directly from suppliers or customers or their authorised
                  representatives. This is done by virtue of the existing
                  contractual relationship between a supplier or customer and
                  Rahn Consolidated.
                  <br />
                  <br /> Rahn Consolidated may also collect your personal
                  information from other sources, if POPIA allows for this to be
                  done, for example, company registration information collected
                  from the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission
                  (CIPC), confirmation of VAT registration with SARS etc.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Once there is no longer a lawful reason for keeping the
                  personal information, the information will either be destroyed
                  or “de- identified” (a process allowed in POPIA and by which
                  information is deleted so that it cannot be linked to an
                  individual or company)
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rahn Consolidated will take reasonably practicable steps to
                  ensure that the personal information is complete, accurate and
                  up to date where necessary. To enable Rahn Consolidated to do
                  so, Rahn Consolidated requires that you promptly notify us of
                  any changes to your personal information.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Rahn Consolidated has put in place technical measures and
                  industry best practices to safeguard personal information
                  against access by unauthorised persons, unlawful disclosure,
                  or breaches.
